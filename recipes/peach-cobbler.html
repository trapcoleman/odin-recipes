    <h3>Get ready for a summer throw down with this classic cobbler.</h3>

    <p>Peach season is pretty much the best time of the year,
         am I right?! I love going to “pick your own” farms
          or buying a large box from a local vendor. Peaches
           are one of those things I could never get sick of!
            I have too many favorite peach recipes that I 
            rotate through them each season, starting with my
             favorite homemade Peach freezer jam.</p>

    <p>This peach cobbler recipe comes from my mom, and it
         is a family favorite recipe she made for us all
          the time growing up! The best part about it is
           that it literally takes 5 minutes to throw
            together! My mom often used a quart jar of
             homemade canned peaches, but you can also
              use fresh peaches!</p>



    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <Ul>
        <li>5 peaches , peeled, cored and sliced (about 4 cups)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    </Ul>

    <h3>For the batter:</h3>
    <Ul>
        <li>6 Tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>ground cinnamon</li>
    </Ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the sliced peaches, sugar and salt to a saucepan and stir to combine. 
            *(If using canned peaches, skip steps 1 & 2 and follow the directions starting at step 3)</li>
        <li>Cook on medium heat for just a few minutes, until the sugar is dissolved
             and helps to bring out juices from the peaches. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Slice butter into pieces and add to a 9x13 inch baking 
            dish. Place the pan in the oven while it preheats, to allow the butter to melt.
             Once melted, remove the pan from the oven.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Stir in the 
            milk, just until combined. Pour the mixture into the pan, over the melted butter and
             smooth it into an even layer.</li>
        <li>Spoon the peaches and juice (or canned peaches, if using) over the batter. Sprinkle
             cinnamon generously over the top.</li>
        <li>Bake at 350 degrees for about 38-40 minutes. Serve warm, with a scoop of ice cream, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
